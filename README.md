## React Project consuming Parse Server API

- In this project I had the objective make an web application with React which consumes a Parse Server API. First there will be a Login page which redirects to a page which the user can switch between links in the navigation menu. Each link shows a mount of images that the API provides.
- So far I've made all the pages and the routes between them with React Router.

## What's Missing?
- I made the connection work but due my scarce time I still have not finished the authentication part and de disposing of images in the HTML. However the system is logging all the objects in the console of the browser to show that the connection is working fine.

## How do I run the project on my PC?
- You must have node intalled
- Clone this repo and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' in the 'front' folder. After that run 'npm install' and 'node app.js' in the 'backend' folder.
- The app will be running on http://localhost:3005
