## React Project consuming Parse Server API

- In this project I had the objective make an web application with React which consumes a Parse Server API. First there will be a Login page which redirects to a page which the user can switch between links in the navigation menu. Each link shows a mount of images that the API provides.
- So far I've made all the pages consume the API and the routes between them with React Router.

## What's Missing?
- The authentication part is still not done.

## How do I run the project on my PC?
- You must have node installed
- Clone this repo and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' in the 'front' folder. After that run 'npm install' and 'node app.js' in the 'backend' folder.
- The app will be running on http://localhost:3005
